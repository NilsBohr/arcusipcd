IPCD Device Simulator


----------------
Introduction
----------------
The IPCD device simulator is a test client for the IPCD server and 
can be used to better understand the IP Connected Device protocol.


----------------
Configure
----------------
Configuration of the IPCD device simulator consists mainly in creating a
model of the device to simulate.  Device model are stored in the devices
directory.

Each device model file must be named
[vendor]-[model]-[serialnum].dev

The distribution contains a model for a single simulated device,
a Multisensor2 made by BlackBox with serial number 00049B3C7A05.

This model can be copied and modified.


----------------
Run
----------------
To run the application, execute the run_device bash or batch script:

./run_device.sh

By default the simulator will use the BlackBox-Multisensor2-00049B3C7A05 model
and connect to ws://localhost:8080/ipcd/1.0

To override these defaults, pass the connection URL and the device model as
arguments to the run_devices script:

./run_device.sh ws://testserver.com/ipcd/1.0 testdevice

In the above case, you would need a valid device model file at 
devices/testdevice.dev


Please verify your environment is configured to use version 1.7 or above of the 
Java VM.


----------------
Console
----------------
Once the device simulator has started, loaded the specified device model, and made
a connection to the IPCD server, you will be given access to a console.  The following
commands can be used to control the simulated device:



bye

Close the connection to the ipcd server and terminate the simulator.
Examples:
  bye
  
			

event [event code]

Sends an event with the given event code.  Valid event codes include:
[onBoot, onConnect, onDownloadComplete, onDownloadFailed, onUpdate, onFactoryReset, 
onValueChange] 
Examples:
  event onBoot
  event onFactoryReset
  
  

report

Sends a report according to the report configuration of the simulated device.
Examples:
  report



ping

Sends a websocket ping to the server
Examples:
  ping
