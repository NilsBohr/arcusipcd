IPCD Server


----------------
Introduction
----------------
This stand-alone IPCD server is well suited to test against while developing
IPCD agents.  

After pointing an agent to the server, you can use the server's console to inspect the 
IPCD messages sent between the agent and the server.  You can also use the console to
send commands to a connected agent.

To use this software, you must have a Java 7 runtime environment installed.

See the sections below for information on how to configure and run the server and 
how to use the console.



----------------
Configure
----------------
Configuration options are located in config/ipcd.properties.

To control the address and port the server will bind to, set the bind.address and
tcp.port properties.  By default these are set to bind to any interface on port 8080:

bind.address=0.0.0.0
tcp.port=8080

By default the server is set to use plaintext sockets (http and ws rather than https 
and wss).  Configuration options allow you to enable TLS, to set the location and 
password of a Java keystore containing your server certificate, and to set a key
password if your certificate requires one.:

tls.server=false
tls.server.keystore.filepath=keystore.jks
tls.server.keystore.password=password
tls.server.key.password=keypass

To test with TLS, set tls.server to true and generate a certificate as follows:
cd ./config

keytool -genkey -keyalg RSA -alias myplatform -keystore keystore.jks -storepass password -validity 360 -keysize 2048

Where -keystore must agree with tls.server.keystore.filepath and -storepass must
agree with tls.server.keystore.password.

You will be prompted by the Java Keytool utility to enter cn, ou, o, l, st, and c and
finally prompted to enter a key password.  The key password must agree with 
tls.server.key.password.

Remember, to give the agent a ws:// URL when tls.server is false.  When using TLS
the agent will require a wss:// URL.



----------------
Run
----------------
To run the application, execute the run_server bash or batch script:

./run_server.sh

Please verify your environment is configured to use version 1.7 or above of the 
Java VM.


----------------
Console
----------------
Once the server has started you should connect at least one device.  After a device is
connected you can use the console to send it commands.  Because the server will
allow multiple devices to be connected at the same time, you have to tell the console
which device you want to interact with by using the device command.  See below for
the list of commands accepted by the console:


help [command]

Commands are [Device, GetParameterValues, SetParameterValues, GetParameterInfo, GetDeviceInfo,
GetReportConfiguration, SetReportConfiguration, GetEventConfiguration, SetEventConfiguration, 
Download, Upload, Reboot, FactoryReset, Leave, Help].  For more information on a command, enter 
help [command].
Examples:
  help
  help SetParameterValues
			



device <vendor> <model> <serialnum>

Device is a console-only command (not part of the IPCD protocol) that selects a device to
interact with on the console.  After specifying a device, all protocol commands entered 
into the console are sent to that device.  An error will be returned if no device with the
provided identity is currently connected
Examples:
  Device BlackBox Multisensor2 00049B3C7A05
			



GetParameterValues [txnid=id] [parameter1] [parameter2] ... [parameterN]

Sends a GetParameterValues command to the currently selected device.  Parameters to
retrieve may be specified as additional arguments.  If no parameters are specified
then all parameters should be returned (see the IPCD specification).
Examples:
  GetParameterValues
  GetParameterValues temperature relhumidity units
			



SetParameterValues [txnid=id] [parameter1=value1] [parameter2=value2] ... [parameterN=valueN]

Sends a SetParameterValues command to the currently selected device.  Parameter
name=value pairs may be specified as additional arguments.  If no parameters are specified
then all parameters should be returned (see the IPCD specification).  The console will attempt
to determine the type of the value but if a value is surrounded by quotes, then it will be
sent as a string.
Examples:
  SetParameterValues temperature=20.0
  SetParameterValues temperature=20.0 units=C
			



GetParameterInfo [txnid=id]

Sends a GetParameterInfo command to the currently selected device.
Examples:
  GetParameterInfo
			



GetDeviceInfo [txnid=id]

Sends a GetDeviceInfo command to the currently selected device.
Examples:
  GetDeviceInfo
			



GetReportConfiguration [txnid=id]

Sends a GetReportConfiguration command to the currently selected device.
Examples:
  GetReportConfiguration




SetReportConfiguration [txnid=id] [report_interval] [parameter1] ... [parameterN]

Sends a GetReportConfiguration command to the currently selected device.  If the
first argument is a number, the console interprets that as a report interval
in seconds.  Otherwise, all other arguments are assumed to be parameters that
should be included in subsequent reports from the device (see the IPCD
specification.)
Examples:
  SetReportConfiguration 300
  SetReportConfiguration 60 temperature relhumidity
  SetReportConfiguration relhumidity
			



GetEventConfiguration [txnid=id]

Sends a GetEventConfiguration command to the currently selected device.
Examples:
  GetEventConfiguration




SetEventConfiguration [txnid=id] event1,event2,eventN parameter1=valchange_event[:valchange_value]

Sends a SetEventConfiguration command to the currently selected device.  The
first argument must be a comma-delimited set of events to enable which is a
subset of [onBoot, onConnect onDownloadComplete, onDownloadFailed, onUpdate,
onFactoryReset, onValueChange].  Each subsequent argument represents the set of
value change thresholds for a given parameter where valid value change events
may include [onChange, onChangeBy, onEquals, onLessThan, onGreaterThan].  Only
those events supported by the device and only those change change thresholds
supported by the specific parameter will be accepted (see the IPCD specification)
Examples:
  SetEventConfiguration onBoot,onConnect,onUpdate,onValueChange temparature=onLessThan:5,onGreaterThan:23 relhumidity=onChange




Download [txnid=id] url

Sends a Download command to the currently selected device which causes it to
fetch the file at the given URL." +
Examples:
  Download https://myservice.com/images/BlackBox/Multisensor2/2.03.bin
			



Reboot [txnid=id]

Sends a Reboot command to the currently selected device.
Examples:
  Reboot




FactoryReset [txnid=id]
Sends a FactoryReset command to the currently selected device.
Examples:
  FactoryReset
